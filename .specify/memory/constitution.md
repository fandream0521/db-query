# Project Constitution

**Project Name:** db-query  
**Constitution Version:** 1.0.0  
**Ratification Date:** 2025-12-14  
**Last Amended Date:** 2025-12-14

## Purpose

This constitution defines the non-negotiable principles and governance rules for the db-query project. All development work, code reviews, and architectural decisions must align with these principles.

## Principles

### Principle 1: TypeScript Frontend

**Rule:** The frontend MUST be implemented using TypeScript.

**Rationale:** TypeScript provides static type checking, improved developer experience, and better code maintainability for frontend development.

### Principle 2: Strict Type Annotations

**Rule:** Both frontend and backend MUST have strict type annotations throughout the codebase.

**Rationale:** Strict typing ensures type safety, reduces runtime errors, improves code documentation, and enhances IDE support and refactoring capabilities.

### Principle 3: JSON camelCase Format

**Rule:** All JSON data generated by the backend MUST use camelCase format for property names.

**Rationale:** camelCase is the standard JavaScript/TypeScript naming convention, ensuring consistency between backend JSON responses and frontend TypeScript interfaces.

### Principle 4: No Authentication Required

**Rule:** The application MUST NOT require authentication. Any user can access and use all features without authentication.

**Rationale:** This simplifies the user experience and removes barriers to entry, making the database query tool accessible to all users immediately.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

1. Proposed amendments must be documented with clear rationale.
2. Amendments affecting principle definitions require version bump (MAJOR for removals/redefinitions, MINOR for additions).
3. All amendments must be reflected in the constitution file with updated version and last amended date.
4. Dependent templates and documentation must be updated to reflect constitutional changes.

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

All code contributions, architectural decisions, and feature implementations must be reviewed against this constitution. Non-compliance must be addressed before merge/acceptance.
